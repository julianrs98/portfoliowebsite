# portfoliowebsite

In this project I have learned how to:
# 👉🏻 build website with traingle by using sass mixins, and generate them
# 👉🏻 using JS ES6+ to make elements dynamic
# 👉🏻 design all the website by myself in Adobe XD
# 👉🏻 arranging the html elements and develop knowledge of properties
# In this project I was feeling as I am placing the boxes of lego 😋
